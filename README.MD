Release:Alpha - not yet ready....

Scripts:
1. build_agisoft_project.py creates a series of directories 
that I like to use for all of my Agisoft projects in my main project folder.

2. Agisoft_Image_Overlap_Counter uses two scripts.  One is an Agisoft 
script to create a shapefile of image footprints (published by Agisoft).
Once the shapefile is created run the second script -this script 
requires an ArcGIS installation.  This script creates a raster that shows 
the total number of images overlapping any given pixel in the raster.
